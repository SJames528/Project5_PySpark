Our code is an attempt to parallelise aspects of the RSA encryption scheme. The parts of the repo are:

* when12.txt    : The text file we aim to encrypt
* datamaker.py  : An app to convert this text file into a workable binary list (using ASCII) [no pySpark]

* primeApp.py   : Generates a random integer and uses pySpark to deduce if this number is prime.
* PySpark.ipynb : Encrypts the binary data file using RSA, parallelising using pySpark

The programs should be run in this order
